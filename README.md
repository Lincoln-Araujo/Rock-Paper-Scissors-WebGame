:memo:**Why did I do this project?** 
<p style="font-size: 16px">
    This is the final assignment that I did in the programming training course offered by <a href="https://www.brainnest.consulting/" target="_blank"> BRAINNEST </a>. 
    How this game have a rule that the player must win 5 rounds to be the champion, making a loop was a little challenge because 'while' is a kind of loop really annoying if you do not know how to make it stops. In the end, I could find a way to use 'while' with some 'ifs' to prevent input errors.
